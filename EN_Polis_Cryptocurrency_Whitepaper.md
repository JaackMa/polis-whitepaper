A multidisciplinary team that seeks to complement each other creating synergy for the benefit of the Polis community. Oriented to generate value to consolidate the currency so that you give back to all the Polis stakeholders,  particularly the most in need. 

## Abstract

Polis (ticker: POLIS) is a cryptocurrency oriented towards the community. This cryptocurrency has a system of self-financing through decentralized government.  One of the main focuses is to serve as source between the digital communities and marginalized environments of the countries in development. Supported by a strong digital community and promoting financial developments, economic and digital innovation, Polis aims to be a thrust of change in the communities. This coin does not have nor will have an ICO or a “Crowdfunding”. The team of developers is maintained using the premine generated (1%) and keeping the 1% of Masternodes of the currency, ensuring that 99% will be in the hands of the community. In the future, the mode of financing the projects that will be held on this platform will be consulted with the community. 

Polis comes from the greek, and it means community, “Polis empowers people”. Polis is a cryptocurrency for the community. People thrive when they can connect and trade freely. Polis uses decentralized advanced blocks chain technology to solve important problems for our global community.

## Legal

We, the team of developers of Polis affirm that the content of this document is our authoring (reviewed by some members of our community). Some of the contents that were used were taken from other sources listed in the acknowledgments.

Thus, it is important to clarify that the investment in cryptocurrency is high risk and is not suitable for some members. Before using polis (or any other cryptocurency) it is important to consider the nature, complexity and risk inherent in the exchange of the same. It is important not to use coins without taking into account the possible loss, since the type of change in these currencies is highly volatile and it is outside the Polis team to regulate the same.

In addition, we clarify that the team of developers of Polis, having no control over the use of currency, is not responsible of the uses that other community members, persons or institutions make of it.

## 1. A brief explanation of the The Blockchain

### 1.1. Starting point (A system of payment between peers)

In 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto publishes the base document for the creation of Bitcoins, a payment system without the need for a third party to confirm and validate the transfer through a system called "The Blockchain" (Bitcoin: A Peer -to-Peer Electronic Cash System, 2009).

Through this system, the intention is to achieve a financial revolution where people can have higher safety in transactions and handling their money.

Since the launch of Bitcoin, many alternative options and currencies have emerged. In 2013, Evan Duffield launched the Dash announcement, proposing a payment system based on the Blockchain, which main characteristic is the self-financing system and the network of masternodes. (Dash Whitepaper, 2013).


### 1.2. The Blockchain

The blockchain, as its name implies, is a set of blocks created by the interconnected and confirmed nodes. Each of these blocks contains the necessary information to fit the chain through the consensus of the "workers".

### 1.3. The reward system

In all the different distributions of the Blockchain there are three types of reward for jobs: Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, Masternodes. These jobs contribute to the creation and confirmation of the Blockchain and each new block distributes the reward among those who perform the job.

In the configuration of the Polis Blockchain, the reward is aimed only at the Proof-of-Work and the Masternodes.

To make the investment in Polis attractive, we have generated a lucky system called "Lucky-PoW". This system will reward users (both miners and master nodes) who find a specific block.

The central development team of Polis is carrying out technical and economic research to create a system to limit the generation of Masternodes in which during the first year of release, it will block the number of nodes that can be generated. This will bring the following benefits:

- To return static investment for investors.
- To avoid that large amounts of Polis are blocked, for free circulation.
- Polis initial price increase.
- Ease in creating consensus among the owners of a master node.
- Limit the capability to vote for a select group.


### 1.4. Decentralized government system

A Blockchain with a decentralized and self-financing government system seeks to empower the community to decide its own future. This system allows anyone to make a proposal to the community and submit it to a vote by the master nodes to direct the future of the currency and projects.

## 2. Introducing Polis

### 2.1. The Initial Team

In 2017, a group of entrepreneurs raised the possibility of taking the world of cryptocurrencies to the foundations of society so that they are useful for people’s daily life. Thus, they looked for the suitable alternatives. In December 2017, Polis is created.

In 2018 Polis has a change in its vision. In addition to working as a bridge between digital currencies and local services and goods that people need, the idea emerged to work as a platform to enhance self-financed and profitable projects that improve the lives of people in developing countries.

To read more about the mission and vision of the Polis team, you can consult the Polis Manifesto.

### 2.2. The Community Team

The community of Polis, has been developing spontaneously, with an impressive growth in the number of "fans" in a short time. Because of the characteristics of the essence of this currency, decentralized and democratic government that wants to achieve a substantial change in the lives of the most in need in the world, a collaborative work environment has been possible, where each member has contributed to the same community, with their time, their will, in a generous way to contribute to the common good. A concrete example is the roadmap, which has been retouched and enriched by several of the members and not exclusively by the developers. This generates value and confidence; definitely, Polis wants to be: a collaborative value-added platform in continuous development, that adds and exponentially multiplies Polis' own value.

### 2.3. Quick start distribution

To create the Polis projects, a quick start distribution is necessary. For that reason, the reward of the block in 20 Polis was established. To maintain this quick distribution, it will continue during the following 4 years. In the fifth year the reward will be reduced to the 10th part to continue the production in 10 years. Once the distribution period is over, the reward will be obtained from the payment of the transaction.

## 4. Cryptocurrency for a better world 

Since 2009 Crptocurrency has revolutionized the manner in which we perceive finance around the world. Some people speculate that this is one of the greatest frauds in mankind’s history, others believe that it is truly a revolution and that it will bring real benefits to mankind and in particular to people.

Aside from regulation, personal enrichment and the new traits of new technologies, to lead Cryptocurrency (specifically Polis) to real world, it is necessary to change mentality and to raise awareness in people.

To achieve this purpose, Polis has the intention to take the following procedure:

1. The creation of a digital community, sensitive to the world’s needs and capable to perceive all the different aspects of the global community.
2. To integrate Polis to the world, through changing digital currency to fiat currency.
3. To create a circulation system for Polis through Polis Market.
4. To start a Foundation that develops projects which can be self-sustainable, profitable and with great impact..
